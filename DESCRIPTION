Description: Implements a semi-supervised learning framework for finite mixture
    models under a mixed label-missingness mechanism. The approach models both
    missing completely at random (MCAR) and entropy-based missing at random
    (MAR) processes using a logistic–entropy formulation. Estimation is carried
    out via an Expectation–Conditional Maximisation (ECM) algorithm with robust
    initialisation routines for stable convergence. The methodology relates to
    the statistical perspective and informative missingness behaviour discussed
    in Ahfock and McLachlan (2020) <doi:10.1007/s11222-020-09971-5> and
    Ahfock and McLachlan (2023) <doi:10.1016/j.ecosta.2022.03.007>. The package
    provides functions for data simulation, model estimation, prediction, and
    theoretical Bayes error evaluation for analysing partially labelled data
    under realistic mixed missingness mechanisms.
